A python flask SPA that I created in 2018 for my master's thesis.

This project was created purely for non-commercal purposes.

It uses a MySQL Database with metadata imported from the european data portal https://data.europa.eu/en API. 

There is a lot of bad practices like not properly building functions that can be reused and writing long badly optimized SQL queries in code.
